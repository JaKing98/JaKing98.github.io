# Work experience
* Spring 2023 - Summer 2024: Full-Time Research Assistant
  * University of California San Diego (UCSD)
  * Xiaolong Wang's Lab
  * Duties included:
      + Manually crafting and setting up the experimental environment for sim2real testing
      + Designing experiments to validate policies trained in simulations
      + Conducting practical experimental operations, recording the results for further analysis
      + Learning about *Reinforcement Learning Techniques*
      + A paper has been submitted to ICRA 2024 (International Conference on Robotics and Automation)
      + Employed SolidWorks to assemble the robotic hand components and exported them into '.urdf' file format
      + Modified the descriptions of collision meshes within the '.urdf' file, reconstructed collision models using basic geometric shapes in Blender, and exported them in direct coding description, or '.obj' and '.glb' file formats
      + Altered the descriptions of visual meshes within the '.urdf' file, using Blender to adjust their surface material properties for a more realistic representation in a virtual environment
      + Tested the modified `.urdf' files using different simulators (IsaacGym, SAPIEN, PyBullet) to assess their visual effects and collision states      
  * Supervisor: Professor Xiaolong Wang
 
* Spring 2022 - Summer 2023: Part-Time Research Assistant
  * University of California San Diego (UCSD)
  * Bioinspired Robotics and Design Lab (BRDLab)
  * Duties included:
      + Independently in charge of a research project
      + Using SolidWorks design and 3D-printed accessories for experiments
      + Using CAD to design and manufacture different robot models
      + Using Tracker(video analysis and modeling tool) to gather data from recorded video
      + Using Matlab and Excel to process and analyze experimental data
      + Create figures and complete academic article writing
      + The article has been accepted by FRAI (Frontiers in Robotics and AI) journal
  * Supervisor: Professor Michael T. Tolley

* Summer 2019: Lab Intern
  * Institute of Metrology, National Institute of Metrology, China
