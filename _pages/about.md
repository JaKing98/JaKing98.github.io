# Educational Background

I have completed my Bachelor's degree in *Measurement and Control Technique and Equipment* from the **Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)**. Building upon my undergraduate education, I pursued a Master's degree in *Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering* at the **University of California San Diego (UCSD)**. My Master's degree journey involved intensive thesis writing, conducted under the exceptional guidance of Professor [Michael T. Tolley](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/node/3561) in the renowned [Bioinspired Robotics and Design Lab](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/bioinspired/).

After completing my Masterâ€™s degree, I joined Professor [Xiaolong Wang's Lab](https://xiaolonw.github.io/group.html) at the **University of California San Diego (UCSD)** as a Research Assistant. In this role, I have been deeply involved in pioneering research projects at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Robotics, collaborating closely with a team of exceptional researchers under the guidance of Professor Wang.

Starting in the Fall 2024, I will be pursuing a Ph.D. at **Pennsylvania State University**, where I will be conducting research under the supervision of Professor [Xiaogang Hu](https://hhd.psu.edu/contact/xiaogang-hu), collaborating with members of the [Neuromechanics Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/nml1/).
